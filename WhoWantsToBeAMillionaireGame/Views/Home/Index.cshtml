            <p>The game on "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" is a series of multiple-choice questions that each have four possible answers (A,B,C,D). The contestant must answer 15 of these questions correctly, one at a time, in order to win the million złoty. As soon as the contestant answers a question incorrectly, the game is over.</p>
            <p>During their game, the player has two "safety nets" – if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize. If a contestant feels unsure about an answer and does not wish to play on, they can walk away with the money they have won.</p>
